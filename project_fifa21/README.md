### Classification and regression on the FIFA 21 players database

This is a simple analysis to showcase some classification and regression tasks performed on the database of player attributes of the FIFA 21 video game.

The database contains information on physical characteristics, roles and positions, skill attributes, and market values of the football players featured in the game. I use this data to perform classification tasks (such as predicting a player's position based on their skill attributes) and regression tasks (such as predicting a player's market value based on their skill atrributes and position on the pitch).

Please open the file classification_regression_fifa21.ipynb to have a look at the analysis.

The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-21-complete-player-dataset).
