# Welcome

I am a data scientist with a background in economics and experience in consulting, where I have applied data
science and econometrics to tackle problems in a range of industries, including: digital markets,
banking, insurance, aviation, railways, freight shipping, energy markets, and pharmaceuticals.

I am currently looking for opportunities to combine my data science and programming skills with my
understanding of business and economic dynamics to deliver actionable insights.
