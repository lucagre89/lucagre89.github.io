# Welcome

I am a data scientist with a background in economics and experience in consulting, where I have applied data
science and econometrics to tackle problems in a range of industries, including: digital markets,
banking, insurance, aviation, railways, freight shipping, energy markets, and pharmaceuticals.

I am currently looking for opportunities to combine my data science and programming skills with my
understanding of business and economic dynamics to deliver actionable insights.

## Portfolio
Here are some projects that I worked on in the past.

### Project 1 - classification and regression tasks on the FIFA 21 players database

This is a simple analysis to showcase some classification and regression tasks performed on the database of player attributes of the FIFA 21 video game. The database contains information on physical characteristics, roles and positions, skill attributes, and market values of the football players featured in the game. I use this data to perform classification tasks (such as predicting a player's position based on their skill attributes) and regression tasks (such as predicting a player's market value based on their skill atrributes and position on the pitch).

### Project 2 - analysis of house prices in Germany

This project was submitted as my dissertation for the Postgraduate Certificate in Applied Data Science at Birkbeck University. It is an investigation of the housing market in Germany from both a data science perspective and an economic perspective. The first part is more focused on data exploration and visualisations, and applies a range of standard data science techniques. The second part is more focused on model selection and studying relationships from an economic point of view, such as estimating the impact of having one additional room on the house price.
